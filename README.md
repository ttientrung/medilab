## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ttientrung/medilab.git
    ```
    This command downloads the complete source code of the Medilab project from the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd medilab
    ```
    This command changes the current directory in your terminal to the Medilab project directory, allowing you to work with the project files.
3.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    This command creates a virtual environment, a self-contained directory that isolates the project's dependencies from the system-wide Python installation, preventing conflicts and ensuring reproducibility.
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
        This command activates the virtual environment on Windows, making the project's dependencies available to the current terminal session.
    *   **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        This command activates the virtual environment on macOS and Linux, making the project's dependencies available to the current terminal session.
5.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command installs all the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that the project has all the necessary dependencies to run correctly.
6.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    This command applies the database migrations, creating the necessary tables and schemas in the database to support the application's data model.
7.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    This command starts the Django development server, allowing you to access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Project Structure

The project is meticulously organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

*   `medilab/`: The heart of the application, containing Django app configurations, models, views, and forms that define the core functionality of the medical system.
*   `doctor/`: A dedicated Django app for managing doctor-related functionalities, such as appointment scheduling, patient management, and medical record access.
*   `user/`: A Django app responsible for user authentication and profile management, ensuring secure access to the application for doctors, patients, and administrators.
*   `templates/`: A repository for HTML templates, which define the structure and layout of the user interface, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
*   `static/`: A collection of static files, including CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, and images, that enhance the visual presentation and interactivity of the application.
*   `models/`: A directory containing pre-trained machine learning models, which are used for disease prediction and data analysis, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
*   `requirements.txt`: A comprehensive list of Python dependencies, ensuring that the project can be easily set up and run on any machine with the required packages installed.
*   `manage.py`: A Django management script, providing a command-line interface for performing various administrative tasks, such as running database migrations, creating superusers, and starting the development server.
